Features that I added:
    Created an animation of the letters spinning on the slot machine
    Created the ".vscode" folder, which makes debugging so much easier now that I have GUI tools
    Created the "constants.hpp" header file, which makes keeping track & modifing the number constants very easy

Runtime errors that I fixed:
    Replaced the unicode symbols with regular characters, which fixed the error where all text was a jumbled mess

Other changes that I made
    Removed the command line arguments, because they weren't even used
    Removed the "addicon()" function, because it was completely unnessary
